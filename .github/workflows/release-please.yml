# Release Please workflow
# Runs on push to main to create/update release PRs
# When a release PR is merged, creates a GitHub Release and tag
# Then triggers the cargo-dist Release workflow via workflow_dispatch
#
# Note: Tags created by GITHUB_TOKEN do NOT trigger other workflows'
# on.push.tags events (GitHub security limitation). We work around this
# by explicitly dispatching the Release workflow after release creation.
