Yarn package manager support for the vx universal tool manager.

## Status

üöß **Under Development** - This crate is currently under development and not yet implemented.

## Overview

`vx-pm-yarn` will provide Yarn package manager support for vx, enabling fast and reliable package management for JavaScript/Node.js projects through the vx interface.

## Planned Features

- **Yarn Package Manager**: Full Yarn package management capabilities
- **Workspace Support**: Yarn workspaces and monorepo support
- **PnP (Plug'n'Play)**: Zero-installs and Plug'n'Play support
- **Berry Support**: Yarn 2+ (Berry) modern features
- **Script Execution**: Run package.json scripts through vx
- **Cache Management**: Efficient package caching and management
- **Lock File**: yarn.lock file management and integrity

## Planned Commands

### Package Management
```bash
# Install packages (planned)
vx yarn install
vx yarn add express
vx yarn add --dev jest
vx yarn remove express

# Update packages (planned)
vx yarn upgrade
vx yarn upgrade express
vx yarn outdated
```

### Project Management
```bash
# Initialize projects (planned)
vx yarn init
vx yarn init -y

# Run scripts (planned)
vx yarn run dev
vx yarn run build
vx yarn run test
vx yarn start

# Information (planned)
vx yarn list
vx yarn info express
```

### Workspace Management
```bash
# Workspace commands (planned)
vx yarn workspaces list
vx yarn workspace <workspace-name> add express
vx yarn workspace <workspace-name> run build
```

## Current Status

This crate is currently in the planning phase. JavaScript/Node.js package management is currently provided through the [`vx-pm-npm`](../vx-pm-npm/README.md) crate.

For immediate JavaScript development needs, please use:
- [`vx-pm-npm`](../vx-pm-npm/README.md) - NPM package manager (available now)
- [`vx-tool-node`](../../vx-tools/vx-tool-node/README.md) - Node.js runtime with npm

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Basic Yarn Classic (v1) support
2. **Phase 2**: Yarn Berry (v2+) support
3. **Phase 3**: Workspace and monorepo features
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (PnP, Zero-installs)

## Yarn vs NPM

### Yarn Advantages (Planned)
- **Faster**: Parallel package installation
- **Deterministic**: Lockfile ensures consistent installs
- **Workspaces**: Built-in monorepo support
- **Offline**: Offline package installation
- **Security**: Enhanced security features
