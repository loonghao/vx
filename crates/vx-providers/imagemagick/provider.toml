# ImageMagick Provider Manifest
# This file defines the metadata, runtimes, and dependency constraints for ImageMagick.
#
# ImageMagick is a powerful image manipulation software suite.
#
# Installation strategy by platform:
# - Linux x86_64: Direct download of AppImage binary (no package manager needed)
# - macOS: Uses Homebrew (vx-managed brew runtime)
# - Windows: Uses package managers in priority order:
#   1. winget (priority=95) - Built-in on Windows 11, preferred
#   2. choco (priority=80) - Chocolatey, common in CI
#   3. scoop (priority=60) - Alternative package manager
#
# Note: Windows portable .7z archives exist but we prefer package managers for:
# - Better reliability in CI environments
# - Automatic PATH configuration
# - Easier updates and uninstallation
#
# This is a "version-insensitive" tool - users just need "any working version"
