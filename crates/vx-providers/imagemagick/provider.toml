# ImageMagick Provider Manifest
# This file defines the metadata, runtimes, and dependency constraints for ImageMagick.
#
# ImageMagick is a powerful image manipulation software suite.
# - Linux: Uses AppImage binary from imagemagick.org (direct download)
# - macOS: Requires Homebrew (vx-managed brew runtime)
# - Windows: Requires Chocolatey or Scoop (vx-managed choco/scoop runtime)
#
# Installation flow:
# 1. Resolver detects platform-specific dependencies (brew on macOS, choco/scoop on Windows)
# 2. Resolver ensures package managers are installed first
# 3. ImageMagick is installed via the appropriate package manager
#
# This is a "version-insensitive" tool - users just need "any working version"
