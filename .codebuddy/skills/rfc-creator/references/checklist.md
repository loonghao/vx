# RFC Creation Checklist

Use this checklist when creating a new RFC.

## Pre-Writing Research Checklist (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **Get current date** - Use MCP time tool to get accurate date for research
- [ ] **Identify search terms** - List keywords for the RFC topic
- [ ] **Web searches completed** - At least 3 relevant searches performed
  - [ ] Search 1: "[topic] implementation rust [year]"
  - [ ] Search 2: "[topic] best practices [major project] [year]"
  - [ ] Search 3: "[topic] library comparison rust [year]"
- [ ] **Source code examined** - Reviewed at least 2-3 major project implementations
  - [ ] Project 1: [name] - [what was learned]
  - [ ] Project 2: [name] - [what was learned]
  - [ ] Project 3: [name] - [what was learned]
- [ ] **Comparison table drafted** - Feature comparison across projects
- [ ] **Design decisions documented** - Listed what to adopt from each project

## Pre-Writing Checklist

- [ ] **Identify the problem** - What specific issue does this address?
- [ ] **Research alternatives** - What existing solutions exist?
- [ ] **Scope definition** - Is this one RFC or should it be split?
- [ ] **Target audience** - Who needs to review this?
- [ ] **Timeline** - What's the target version/release?
